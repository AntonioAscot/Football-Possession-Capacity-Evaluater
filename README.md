# Football-Possession-Capacity-Evaluater
Evaluates the capacity of a football team to work with the possession of the ball and keep it.

Now, the software only calculates the capacity, but the database only works in a lone session due the software corresponds only as a client-side application.
At the final stage, the software will be able to work server-side and create huge databases.
